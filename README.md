## 📚 How It Works

### 1. Choose Your Theme
Enter any theme relevant to your tamariki's interests and experiences:
- Nature themes: "Kererū in the forest", "Tuatara on a rock"
- Daily life: "Kai time at the marae", "Playing in the sandpit"
- Cultural events: "Matariki celebration", "Whānau gathering"
- Emotions: "Feeling proud", "Sharing with friends"

### 2. Generate Your Pack
The app creates a complete learning pack with:

#### 🎬 **Scene Preview Strip**
At the top of every pack, you'll see a visual strip displaying all four generated images side-by-side:

| Object | Action | Setting | Full Scene |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| 🖼️ | 🖼️ | 🖼️ | 🖼️ |

This **instant visual overview** lets you:
- Quickly assess the coherence of the generated scene
- See all components at a glance
- Choose which images to focus on for different activities
- Print the strip as a standalone sequencing tool

#### 🎨 **Learning Image Set**
Four interconnected images designed for sequencing and storytelling:
- **Object Focus**: Isolated element (e.g., the bird)
- **Action Focus**: The action happening (e.g., flying)
- **Setting Focus**: Where it occurs (e.g., garden)
- **Full Scene**: Everything together in context

Each image is professionally styled with consistent visual elements, modern Tailwind CSS responsive design, and optimized sizing for both screen and print.

#### 🧱 **Scene Components**
Semantic breakdown showing:
- **WHO** - Agent (person/animal doing the action)
- **WHAT DOING** - Action (what's happening)
- **WHAT** - Object (what's being acted upon)
- **WHERE** - Setting (location/context)
- **HOW** - Attribute (qualities/feelings)

Each component includes the English label and NZSL sign name, building children's understanding of how meaning is constructed.

#### 📖 **Story Frames**
Sequential frames for retelling and sequencing:
- Numbered steps building the narrative
- English captions for comprehension
- NZSL glosses showing sign sequence
- Semantic role markers (AGENT, ACTION, LOCATION)

Perfect for:
- Sequencing card activities
- Story retelling practice
- Bilingual expression
- Sign-along storytelling

#### 🎨 **Activity Web**
Four ready-to-use activities:
- **Art**: Creative expression connected to the theme
- **NZSL Language**: Interactive signing games and practice
- **Maths**: Hands-on numeracy experiences
- **Deaf Culture**: Cultural awareness and celebration

#### 💬 **Scaffolding Questions**
Thoughtful prompts to support children's learning:
- WHO questions (identifying agents)
- WHAT questions (understanding actions)
- WHERE questions (recognizing settings)
- Extension questions for deeper thinking

### 3. Use & Adapt
- **Print** for hands-on manipulation and display
- **Download** as PDF for digital sharing
- **Project** on screen for group discussions
- **Adapt** to your tamariki's needs and interests

## 🌈 Pedagogical Foundation

Tohu Kaiako is built on evidence-based early childhood education principles:

### Scene-Based Semantic Learning
Children construct meaning through **visual contexts** rather than isolated vocabulary. By seeing WHO does WHAT to WHAT in WHERE, tamariki understand relationships and build authentic language.

### Bilingual Language Development
**NZSL and English** are presented as equal partners. Sign language is not a "tool" for English—it's a complete, rich language in its own right. Children learn both languages simultaneously through meaningful experiences.

### Deaf Culture Celebration
NZSL is a living language of the Deaf community. Every pack includes:
- Authentic NZSL content (not "signed English")
- Visual-spatial language features (classifiers, facial expressions)
- Deaf cultural awareness activities
- Positive representation of Deaf identity

### Te Whāriki Alignment
Supports all four principles and five strands:
- **Whakamana | Empowerment** - Children develop confidence in both languages
- **Kotahitanga | Holistic Development** - Learning across all domains
- **Whānau Tangata | Family & Community** - Resources families can use together
- **Ngā Hononga | Relationships** - Meaningful interactions through sign and speech

### Universal Design for Learning
Multiple means of:
- **Representation** - Visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic modes
- **Expression** - Sign, speak, or show understanding
- **Engagement** - Choice, relevance, and cultural responsiveness

## 🤝 Best Practices

### Introducing NZSL Signs
1. Show the image first—let children construct meaning visually
2. Introduce the NZSL sign with clear modeling
3. Practice together as a group
4. Use the sign in natural contexts throughout the day
5. Celebrate approximations—signing doesn't have to be "perfect"

### Using Story Frames
1. Present frames out of order—have children sequence them
2. Act out each frame with signs and movement
3. Create your own version by changing one element
4. Record children signing the story
5. Make physical cards for repeated practice

### Extending Activities
1. Follow children's interests—generate related packs
2. Create a "theme week" with multiple related packs
3. Invite Deaf community members to share experiences
4. Document children's learning with photos and videos
5. Display packs in your learning environment
