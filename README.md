# Tohu Kaiako — "Teacher's Sign"

**An AI-powered bilingual learning pack generator for NZSL (New Zealand Sign Language) and English in early childhood education.**

Tohu Kaiako empowers kaiako (teachers) to create rich, culturally responsive learning experiences that celebrate Deaf culture, support bilingual language development, and align with Te Whāriki, Aotearoa New Zealand's early childhood curriculum.

## 🌱 What is Tohu Kaiako?

Tohu Kaiako is a free web application that generates bite-sized bilingual prompts for tamariki (children) aged 3-5 years. Each pack now focuses on one clear sentence and includes:

- **Four illustrations**: noun, verb, where, and the full scene for quick visual sequencing
- **NZSL + English sentence**: a paired gloss and simple English line you can model immediately
- **Language steps**: a three-step teaching flow (Name the noun → Add the verb → Show where)
- **One-page PDF**: printable layout with all four images and the bilingual sentence

Simply enter a theme (like "Fantail in the garden" or "Playing at the beach") and within moments you’ll have a concise resource ready to project, print, or share.

## 📚 How It Works

### 1. Choose Your Theme
Enter any theme relevant to your tamariki's interests and experiences:
- Nature themes: "Kererū in the forest", "Tuatara on a rock"
- Daily life: "Kai time at the marae", "Playing in the sandpit"
- Cultural events: "Matariki celebration", "Whānau gathering"
- Emotions: "Feeling proud", "Sharing with friends"

### 2. Generate Your Pack
Within a few seconds the app returns:

- **Four tiles**: an isolated noun, the same subject doing the verb, a where/location tile, and a combined scene. Each image is grounded in everyday Aotearoa NZ experiences so tamariki recognise what they see.
- **Teaching flow**: a three-step checklist (“Name the noun”, “Add the verb”, “Show where”) to guide your conversation.
- **Bilingual sentence**: NZSL gloss and simple English sentence built from the generated components.
- **Download options**: preview or download a one-page PDF that lays out the four tiles with the bilingual sentence for printing or sharing with whānau.

### 3. Use & Adapt
- **Print** the single-page PDF as a prompt card or learning centre resource
- **Project** the tiles for group kōrero (discussion) and signing practice
- **Share** digitally with whānau to reinforce language at home
- **Regenerate** with new prompts to build a set around the same theme

## 🌈 Pedagogical Foundation

Tohu Kaiako is built on evidence-based early childhood education principles:

### Scene-Based Semantic Learning
Children construct meaning through **visual contexts** rather than isolated vocabulary. By seeing WHO does WHAT to WHAT in WHERE, tamariki understand relationships and build authentic language.

### Bilingual Language Development
**NZSL and English** are presented as equal partners. Sign language is not a "tool" for English—it's a complete, rich language in its own right. Children learn both languages simultaneously through meaningful experiences.

### Deaf Culture Celebration
NZSL is a living language of the Deaf community. Every pack includes:
- Authentic NZSL content (not "signed English")
- Visual-spatial language features (classifiers, facial expressions)
- Deaf cultural awareness activities
- Positive representation of Deaf identity

### Te Whāriki Alignment
Supports all four principles and five strands:
- **Whakamana | Empowerment** - Children develop confidence in both languages
- **Kotahitanga | Holistic Development** - Learning across all domains
- **Whānau Tangata | Family & Community** - Resources families can use together
- **Ngā Hononga | Relationships** - Meaningful interactions through sign and speech

### Universal Design for Learning
Multiple means of:
- **Representation** - Visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic modes
- **Expression** - Sign, speak, or show understanding
- **Engagement** - Choice, relevance, and cultural responsiveness

## 🤝 Best Practices

### Introducing NZSL Signs
1. Show the image first—let children construct meaning visually
2. Introduce the NZSL sign with clear modeling
3. Practice together as a group
4. Use the sign in natural contexts throughout the day
5. Celebrate approximations—signing doesn't have to be "perfect"

### Using the Noun → Verb → Where Flow
1. Reveal the noun tile first and ask tamariki to name/sign it
2. Add the verb tile and model the full NZSL gloss (noun + verb)
3. Show the where tile and complete the bilingual sentence together
4. Reinforce by pointing to the combined scene and retelling the whole idea
5. Invite tamariki to swap in new nouns, verbs, or locations they already know

### Extending Activities
1. Generate multiple variations around the same theme to compare sentences
2. Pair tiles with real-world objects or photos from your centre
3. Invite Deaf community members to model the NZSL sentence
4. Create a wall display that grows with each new noun → verb → where sentence
5. Encourage tamariki to draw their own version and label with NZSL glosses
